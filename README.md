# Finance-Project-FIN501
This was a 3-month project where we used an online trading simulator, StockTrak, with the end deliverable of a report comparing our performance to a benchmark index.
With the Federal Reserve propping up markets by QE and buying corporate debt, we decided to join the speculative wave of retail investors by investing in FANG stocks. 

We calculated and visualized the Efficient Frontier - mix of stocks that balances risk and return - to guide our investing decisions.

We also obtained and visulalized several metrics including:

Daily Simple Returns

Stock Volatility

Stock Correlation

Stock Covariance (Visualized covariance matrix)

Stock returns according to CAPM, Mean Historical Return, James Stein Shrinkage, and EMA Historical Return methods.
