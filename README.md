# Finance-Project-FIN501
This was a 3-month project where we used an online trading simulator, StockTrak, with the end deliverable of a report comparing our performance to a benchmark index.
With the Federal Reserve propping up markets by QE and buying corporate debt, we decided to join the speculative wave of retail investors by investing in FANG assets. 

We initially calculated the Efficient Frontier and obtained the optimal mix of stocks.

We also obtained and visulalized several metrics including:

Daily Simple Returns

Stock Volatility

Stock Correlation

Stock Covariance (Visualized covariance matrix)

Stock returns according to CAPM, Mean Historical Return, James Stein Shrinkage, and EMA Historical Return methods.
