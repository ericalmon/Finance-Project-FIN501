# Finance-Project-FIN501
This was a 3-month project where we used an online trading simulator, StockTrak, with the end deliverable of a report comparing our performance to a benchmark index.
With the Federal Reserve propping up markets by QE and buying corporate debt, we decided to join the speculative wave of retail investors by investing in FANG stocks. 

We calculated and visualized the Efficient Frontier - mix of stocks that balances risk and return - to guide our investing decisions.

We also obtained and visulalized several metrics including: Daily Simple Returns, Stock Volatility, Stock Correlation, Stock Covariance (Visualized covariance matrix), Stock returns according to CAPM, Mean Historical Return, James Stein Shrinkage, and EMA Historical Return methods. 

**Performance Comparison:**

When comparing our portfolio to the performance of the market, we have outperformed the index by about 3%. This in itself is an impressive feat as we have effectively out performed the market, but on top of that we also had a lower standard deviation. This means that we were able to secure a higher return with less overall risk. This means that we have provided a safer and more effective portfolio then the index. 
Cross-asset correlations are also at 20-year highs after the Federal Reserve announced unlimited QE and that it will begin corporate bond purchases (Appendix 5). The financial markets have benefitted from government stimulus and the Federal Reserve propping up the markets through a flood of liquidity. Stuck in self-isolation, retail investors have been piling into the market with low-fee online brokerages such as TD Ameritrade and Robinhood. TD Ameritrade reported 330,000 new accounts last month. Data indicates this investor group favours stocks they are familiar with; FAANG stocks were a favourite because of their online presence and well-known brands. They were among the top 50 buys throughout the quarantine and outperformed the SP500. 

**Investment Strategy:**

Our investment strategy was very simple, we intended to buy a select few stocks based on very specific criteria and hold them until the competition ended. The criteria that we used were: The type of products/ services they sold and a positive BETA with a value of above 1 (Appendix 2.) and finally we looked for stocks that had enough yearly earnings to pay at least half of their long term debt if needed. At the start of the contest, news sources such as CNBC and economists all pointed to one conclusion coming out the thick of covid and that was a V shaped recovery. (Smith, 2020) So in order to capitalize on the long term and steady upwords growth forecasted in the economy we bought high and positive beta stocks with products and services that wouldn't be affected by the Covid pandemic. 
The reason for buying stocks with a high beta, is because it shows that they are highly correlated with the market and will often perform similar or better in uptrending markets. As I write this Tesla, Amazon, Netflix and Nvidia are at all time highs. All with betas near or above 1. So based on our assumption that high beta stocks would perform well in a v-shaped recovery we would have capitalized on some very stable and high earning investments. As can be seen in our choice of investments we were focused mainly on the tech industry. One of the biggest reasons for this is since everyone is stuck at home there would be even more internet usage then before. Streaming has proven to become a huge part of everyday life during quarantine, undoubtedly even more than before.
	When it came to weighting our portfolio we used an efficiency frontier. To do this we crunched data as far back as 2005. Using this data we also found the expected annual return on equity and then based our calculation of the efficiency frontier on this rate of return. The output of this gave us our optimal weights of stocks that provide the most efficient portfolio. (Appendix 3.)

Lessons Learned:
	In today’s climate, current events and statistics sway both public opinion and personal fear.  The extent of its influence in the market however was an aspect of this assignment we did not fully take into account.  Throughout the course we learned how much of a correlation existed between the news and our portfolio performance and the market as a whole.  Each new piece of information regarding COVID-19 could be felt in the market performance for the day.  For example, when many feared a second wave of COVID-19 cases in the United States, the market fell sharply (about 6% for the day) and continued to drop the subsequent day.  However, the opposite was also true as when case numbers showed that the curve was flattening, the market priced in this new felt optimism and rose sharply for the day.  Additionally, we also learned how quickly the market prices in these new pieces of information and as a result how quick opportunities can pass by.  Although we learned about the efficient market hypothesis in class, we did not anticipate how quickly the market would price in newfound optimism or pessimism.  In many cases, the index value would change within the day of a large number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S.  Albeit, the low probability of a similar pandemic event, our experiences throughout the assignment have taught us how quickly information can be priced into the market and how much impact current events can have on market performance.
